# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

This project aims to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using health-related data and machine learning algorithms. It utilizes the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset/data) and applies various data science techniques to build an accurate and reliable model.
